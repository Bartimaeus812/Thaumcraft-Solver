Current capabilities of the project:

    Read aspect conversions from an Obsidian vault or file, then ability to output to file.
    Search for the quickest path between two aspects using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Planned capabilities:

    There are two approaches to solving this minigame I will be pursuing: helping tools or game solving.
    First, I will create helpful tools to make identifying the solutions to each puzzle easier.
    Second, there will be the simulation of the game board and a turn-based game solving algorithm aimed at being efficient with research aspects.
    Also, the research conversions will be easily modifiable
  
  Helping Tools: This will involve creating two tools:
    
    Finding common aspects between a list of aspects
    Finding reasonable paths between two aspects

  Game Solving: Simulating the game:

      Simulating a board:
        Different board sizes
        Aspect placement on the board
        Holes in the board
      Scoring moves based on maintaining the abundance of research aspects
      Determining reasonable (possible) moves based on research conversions
